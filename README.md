# Net-Pi
Net-Pi is a personal network security system run on a Raspberry Pi 4 model, with Pi-Hole, customizable Snort rules, an email alerting system, and a personalized network monitor to form a secure network firewall. The goal of this project is to provide a safer local area network (LAN) for all users. The benefit of implementing this idea on a Raspberry Pi is that it makes it more available to the everyday user, as opposed to the more hard-core PC user.

### To Do List:
- Fix install Setup for Snort
- Provide more information via Network Statistics script
- Automate Weekly Alert Log Script
- Configure Real time email alerts

### Potential further Improvements:
- Custom Anomally Detection System
